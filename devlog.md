I initialized a project with sbt, installed sbt, ran the program sbt, compiled trough sbt, and then "run" : fails.
So instead I cd into src/ and run `scala Main.scala` and it runs.

idk if I really need to learn sbt for this project. For the time being, I'm gonna use `scala Main.scala` because _it just works_.
